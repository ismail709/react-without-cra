# react-without-cra
the default configuration for a minimalist react app with webpack and babel.

if you are tired of waiting the create-react-app command to finish like me, I present to you this blank react app project bundled with webpack and compiled with babel. it's very lightweight and easy to set up.

to-do:
- adding testing library
- adding a task runner
